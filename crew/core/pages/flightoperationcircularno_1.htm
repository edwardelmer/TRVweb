<p>Dear esteemed colleagues</p>

<p>I hope this words finds you well and healthy</p>

<p>Once again, on behalf of training and standard department I would like to express our warmest welcome to our home.</p>

<p>I believe many of you are really enthusiast with aviation industry, we would like to provide you as real as it gets environment. These include proper flying technique, especially approach and landing phase.</p>

<p>These are some highlights that we expect you to comply during approach and landing phase:</p>

<p>1. Decelerated Approach:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Decelerated approach with AP or AP/FD guidance is the standard flying technique for ILS approach and approaches using FINAL APP guidance</li>
	<li>Any approach other than aforementioned should be flown with early stabilized approach technique.</li>
</ul>

<p>2. Final Landing Configuration:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Strongly recommended</strong> to be fully configured at 1500ft to avoid unstable approach</li>
</ul>

<p>3. Stabilized Approach Criteria:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Stabilized approach criteria <strong>must be met at 1000ft AAL, if its not mandatory go around must be carried out.</strong></li>
	<li>Criteria of stabilized approach are:&nbsp;
	<ul>
		<li>The aircraft is on the correct lateral and vertical flight path.</li>
		<li>The aircraft is in the desired landing configuration.</li>
		<li>Thrust is stabilized, usually above idle and the aircraft is at target speed for approach.</li>
		<li>Speedbrake retracted.</li>
		<li>&nbsp;Landing checklist has been completed.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>4. Long Landing and/or Long Flare:</p>

<ul>
	<li>&nbsp;Avoid to &ldquo;de-stabilize&rdquo; the approach below 200ft AAL in order to catch up with the glide path.</li>
	<li>During the approach try to keep aiming point all the way and landing within the touchdown zone.</li>
	<li>For A320 flare height is around 30 feet during normal circumstances, it may differ due to environmental conditions (tailwind, upslope runway, etc)</li>
	<li>Though is not recommended to do so, adjusting vertical speed to smoothen touch down rate its on your discretion.</li>
	<li><strong>However, If long flare is occur and pass the last touchdown zone marking, go around must be carried out to avoid runway overshoot.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Daily and random check will be applied to ensure our quality assurance. <strong>Below mentioned&nbsp;violations without any valid explanation may resulted in PIREP rejection: </strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Unstable approach.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Landing rate above -600 fpm and below -10 fpm.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Touchdown beyond touchdown marking.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I hope all of these regulation will not make our flight less fun, I believe as an enthusiast we really want to be as close as possible with the real world operation.</p>

<p>Your compliance to this circular will be very much appreciated.</p>
