<p><strong>Hi RedChamps !</strong></p>

<p>I hope these words find you well and healthy.<br />
As a promise to keep you updated with our community, this circular will give you some insight about our Virtual Airlines operations for the past few weeks.<br />
We also changed this circular name to <strong><span style="color:#FF0000">RedBriefing</span></strong>, since this edition forward will not contain about flight operation alone, but the whole The Reds Virtual news and updates as well.</p>

<p><br />
<strong><u>FLIGHT OPERATIONS:</u></strong></p>

<p>These are few highlights from the Flight Operations department for this month issue:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>1. Operating procedure compliance:</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left: 80px;">Since last circular we observed a lot of improvement from SOP compliance. Number of unstable approach was significantly reduced, and increasing statistic of go around following unstable approach. Following this trend, we are really confidence that we are now on the correct path to make &ldquo;our sky safer&rdquo;.<br />
We are looking forward for your continuous support and thank you for your compliance.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>2. Long landing and late landing config on approach:</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left: 80px;">Long landing and late landing config are still our main issue.<br />
Based on our PIREP log statistics, once recorded touch down speed down to 105 knots, which extremely unusual.<br />
In the other case our system observed a flight touched down in the middle of the runway. Though those flight managed to land and vacate the runway &ldquo;unharmed&rdquo;, please be advised those kind of technique is not a proper method, compromising your safe flight conduct, and may become the bad habit if it&rsquo;s done continuously.<br />
For your reference, prolonged flare, may result in hard landing due to high vertical acceleration. While we know &ldquo;buttering the bread&rdquo; is a fun side of playing this platform, but we may ended up unlucky with hard and/or long landing if it&rsquo;s not executed properly.<br />
We may remind you once again that any touch down rate less than -10 feet per minute, touch down rate more than -600 feet per minute and landing beyond touchdown marking may result to PIREP rejection.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>3. Green Operation Procedures:</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left: 80px;">After SOP compliance, we also would like to thank you for your continuous support on our green operation campaign. Based on PIREP log observation data, it reveals:<br />
&bull; More than 30% flight applying one engine taxi out procedures<br />
&bull; More than 60% of total flight applying CONF 3 as a final landing config<br />
&bull; More than 50% of total flight applying one engine taxi in procedures</p>

<p style="margin-left: 80px;">We really appreciate your consideration to keep supporting this campaign. But please keep in mind there are some conditions to be followed:<br />
&bull; Config 3 landing shall not be applied when:<br />
➢ Runway pavement length less than 2500 meters.<br />
➢ Tailwind component more than 10 knots.<br />
&bull; One engine taxi procedures shall not be applied when:<br />
➢ Taxi in time to the gate after landing is less than 3 minutes.<br />
➢ Taxi out time may not fulfilled 2 minutes warm up period after 2nd engine start.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>4. The Reds Virtual Standard Operating Procedures:</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left: 80px;">We are happy to inform you that we are now under development of The Reds Virtual Standard Operating Procedures. It will contain normal operating procedures, included the green operations.<br />
